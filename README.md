# Citizen Science for Kids

Citizen Science for Kids consists of a cross-platform field application
which allows students to view projects and collect observations and an admin 
website where teachers can create new projects and view their results.

This platform aims to spark an interest in science for kids and
allow them to contribute to a real live scientific project!
